# FPGA-Based Digital Oscilliscope
## Overview
This FPGA-based digital oscilloscope is implemented on an FPGA-embedded SoC and designed to measure and display peak-to-peak voltage from multiple channels. It features real-time VGA waveform rendering, keyboard-controlled interface adjustments, and ADC signal acquisition.

The project is based on Pong Chuâ€™s prototyping using systemverilog framework, with modifications to the VGA core driver and custom integration of existing software drivers to create an interactive oscilloscope.
